# Bettter-Calculator
A parser which supports any expression a human can write.

# Features:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multi-operation expressions (EX: 1 + 2 + 3 - 4)

# Limitations:
- No parentheses
- No exponents
- No multiplication
- No division
- No variables
- No solving for variables
- No graphing functions

Over time I will be making additions to this repo as I implement these limitations. This whole project is really just a learning experience for me.
